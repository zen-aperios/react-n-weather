weather-app-react-native

# A minimalistic weather app, made from guides and online resources. 

This was initially assigned as an entrance for a job, to learn native. 
but now since i enjoyed playing with the api and native layouts im going to expand on this project in due time. 

thanks for all the online resources towards the development of this application.
